Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Measures loading performance. To provide a good user experience, 
strive to have LCP occur within the first 2.5 seconds of the page starting to load.

First Input Delay (FID): Measures interactivity. To provide a good user experience, 
strive to have an FID of less than 100 milliseconds. 
Starting March 2024, Interaction to Next Paint (INP) will replace FID as a Core Web Vital.

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Measures visual stability. To provide a good user experience, 
strive to have a CLS score of less than 0.1.

CLS - Cumulative Layout Shift - Page layout changing rapidly or slowing so the user is unpreditable to interact
how the user to interact. So google have some score for that is less than 0.1

ex: Go and back button is there
click on go it shows on banner on that back button is not work if banner is showed immediately.so user can interact to banner.
if it is slow banner will glow slow so user is idle for that time that is a CLS score
